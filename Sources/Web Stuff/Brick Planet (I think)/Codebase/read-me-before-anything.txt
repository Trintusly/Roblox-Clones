Alot of work was put into these fixed files, You can create groups etc whatever i don't really care anymore tbh.

You will need to install nginx on your vps as thats what i did to fully get it working along with memchached

all of html goes into your vps root folder thing for example /var/www/html and the other folders go in /var/www/

you will also need to fix up your own cdn, i didn't clear the /cdn/ folder so yea.

have fun i guess database included too fully working.
