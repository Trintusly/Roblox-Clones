Value: Hello, community! Welcome to the forums! Here, you may seek help from our admins and community members. You may also discuss topics related to the subforum you're in. In addition to our terms of service, we have created these forum guidelines for our users to follow. At certain times, BrickPlanet staff members may pin temporary threads that are to be followed as well as these guidelines. 

1. Please don't spam!
You should only post topics related to the topic you're posting in, and the topic you're discussing should be relevant. Spamming threads, posting advertisements, talking about your post count, ect. are all considered spam. Please keep the forum full of quality material!

2. Don't share personal information. It isn't safe!
You should keep all real life information about yourself, to yourself. No one else should be welcome to know your personal information! Phone numbers, email addresses, your real name, and your home address are all confidential information. You should also refrain from asking other users for their personal information. It's just not safe!

3. Do not discuss real life tragedies.
Real world events that involve sensitive topics should not be talked about on BrickPlanet. You are free to create groups commemorating the lives of those lost in real world tragedies, but please keep these topics away from the forums.

4. Do not post offsite links that are not permitted via our terms of service.
Offsite links can be harmful, both to you and your computer. You should never visit websites that you do not trust! BrickPlanet has allowed certain, admin approved offsite links (as per our terms) that you are allowed to post. Those links are:

Youtube.com and its URL shortener/subdomains (i.e. youtu.be/help.youtube.com)
Gyazo.com (screenshot program links)
Twitter.com and its subdomains (i.e. t.co)
Imgur.com (image uploading website)
Prntscr.com (screenshot program links) and its subdomains (i.e. prnt.sc)
Trello.com

In addition to this rule, moderators may review links and ban based on the content at the link. You should also link to "appropriate for all" content only!

5. Do not harass, troll, or put down others!
Be mature! Everyone here uses the same website. You should not be excluding anyone from the forums or trying to make the site an unenjoyable place to go. Instead, you should encourage new players and show them the ropes!

6. Don't post on inappropriate threads. Report them instead!
We appreciate it when people want to help the community by calling someone out on their inappropriate forum post, but this just bumps the post and brings it to the top of the forum. Instead, report the content by using the report abuse button so that a moderator can take care of it! 

7. Post in the correct subforum!
We know that the tumbleweeds fly in certain subforums, but please post topics related to the subforum you're posting in. Threads not pertaining to a subforum will merely be moved anyways, so it is a bit silly to break this rule to begin with.

8. Do not repost your deleted thread.
Posts deleted or moved by community moderators were deleted or moved for a reason. Instead of reposting them, you should message an online moderator and ask how the thread violated the rules so that you'll have a better understanding about our terms.

9. BrickPlanet staff and moderators are exempt from the rules!
BrickPlanet City staff members, moderators, directors, and other staff are exempt from rules we have for our users. This means that they can link to certain websites or post threads not pertaining to subforums. Our staff abide by a separate policy and are therefore excused from our forum and community guidelines. You should take heed to advice given by our staff members! We're here to help, and our inboxes are always open!

Prntscr.com (screenshot program links) and its subdomains (i.e. prnt.sc)
Trello.com

In addition to this rule, moderators may review links and ban based on the content at the link. You should also link to "appropriate for all" content only!

5. Do not harass, troll, or put down others!
Be mature! Everyone here uses the same website. You should not be excluding anyone from the forums or trying to make the site an unenjoyable place to go. Instead, you should encourage new players and show them the ropes!

6. Don't post on inappropriate threads. Report them instead!
We appreciate it when people want to help the community by calling someone out on their inappropriate forum post, but this just bumps the post and brings it to the top of the forum. Instead, report the content by using the report abuse button so that a moderator can take care of it! 

7. Post in the correct subforum!
We know that the tumbleweeds fly in certain subforums, but please post topics related to the subforum you're posting in. Threads not pertaining to a subforum will merely be moved anyways, so it is a bit silly to break this rule to begin with.

8. Do not repost your deleted thread.
Posts deleted or moved by community moderators were deleted or moved for a reason. Instead of reposting them, you should message an online moderator and ask how the thread violated the rules so that you'll have a better understanding about our terms.

9. BrickPlanet staff and moderators are exempt from the rules!
BrickPlanet City staff members, moderators, directors, and other staff are exempt from rules we have for our users. This means that they can link to certain websites or post threads not pertaining to subforums. Our staff abide by a separate policy and are therefore excused from our forum and community guidelines. You should take heed to advice given by our staff members! We're here to help, and our inboxes are always open!

At certain times, BrickPlanet staff members may pin temporary threads that are to be followed as well as these guidelines. 

1. Please dont spam!
You should only post topics related to the topic youre posting in, and the topic youre discussing should be relevant. Spamming threads, posting advertisements, talking about your post count, ect. are all considered spam. Please keep the forum full of quality material!

2. Dont share personal information. It isnt safe!
You should keep all real life information about yourself, to yourself. No one else should be welcome to know your personal information! Phone numbers, email addresses, your real name, and your home address are all confidential information. You should also refrain from asking other users for their personal information. Its just not safe!

3. Do not discuss real life tragedies.
Real world events that involve sensitive topics should not be talked about on BrickPlanet. You are free to create groups commemorating the lives of those lost in real world tragedies, but please keep these topics away from the forums.

4. Do not post offsite links that are not permitted via our terms of service.
Offsite links can be harmful, both to you and your computer. You should never visit websites that you do not trust! BrickPlanet has allowed certain, admin approved offsite links (as per our terms) that you are allowed to post. Those links are:

Youtube.com and its URL shortener/subdomains (i.e. youtu.be/help.youtube.com)
Gyazo.com (screenshot program links)
Twitter.com and its subdomains (i.e. t.co)
Imgur.com (image uploading website)
Prntscr.com (screenshot program links) and its subdomains (i.e. prnt.sc)
Trello.com

In addition to this rule, moderators may review links and ban based on the content at the link. You should also link to "appropriate for all" content only!

5. Do not harass, troll, or put down others!
Be mature! Everyone here uses the same website. You should not be excluding anyone from the forums or trying to make the site an unenjoyable place to go. Instead, you should encourage new players and show them the ropes!

6. Dont post on inappropriate threads. Report them instead!
We appreciate it when people want to help the community by calling someone out on their inappropriate forum post, but this just bumps the post and brings it to the top of the forum. Instead, report the content by using the report abuse button so that a moderator can take care of it! 

7. Post in the correct subforum!
We know that the tumbleweeds fly in certain subforums, but please post topics related to the subforum youre posting in. Threads not pertaining to a subforum will merely be moved anyways, so it is a bit silly to break this rule to begin with.

8. Do not repost your deleted thread.
Posts deleted or moved by community moderators were deleted or moved for a reason. Instead of reposting them, you should message an online moderator and ask how the thread violated the rules so that youll have a better understanding about our terms.

9. BrickPlanet staff and moderators are exempt from the rules!
BrickPlanet City staff members, moderators, directors, and other staff are exempt from rules we have for our users. This means that they can link to certain websites or post threads not pertaining to subforums. Our staff abide by a separate policy and are therefore excused from our forum and community guidelines. You should take heed to advice given by our staff members! Were here to help, and our inboxes are always open!

Posts deleted or moved by community moderators were deleted or moved for a reason. Instead of reposting them, you should message an online moderator and ask how the thread violated the rules so that youll have a better understanding about our terms.

9. BrickPlanet staff and moderators are exempt from the rules!
BrickPlanet City staff members, moderators, directors, and other staff are exempt from rules we have for our users. This means that they can link to certain websites or post threads not pertaining to subforums. Our staff abide by a separate policy and are therefore excused from our forum and community guidelines. You should take heed to advice given by our staff members! Were here to help, and our inboxes are always open!
