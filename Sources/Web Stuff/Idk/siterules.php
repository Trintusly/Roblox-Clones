		<font style='font-size:17px;'>2. Items</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		All the items you upload are your property. If another user copies your item, please report it to us immediately at items@social-paradise.net and we will take care of it. On the other hand, if you copy another item without authorized permission, we will take punishments very hard. Your account will be frozen in a range from 7 days to termination. If you had sufficient permission to re-upload a similar item from the ORIGINAL item with proof, please send us an email at appeals@social-paradise.net to have your ban appealed. We will need a screenshot of the way your other party has interacted, it has to be on SP, we can not track other conversations on 3rd party sites.<br /><b><font color='red'>Uploading an item from another site that is not yours or you made is strictly forbidden.</font></b>
		</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>3. Members</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		You are expected to treat all users, nobody who it is, in a kind manner. All 'personal attack,' harassing, and so-forth is not aloud.
		</font>
		<br /><br />

		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		Hacking on BrickPlanet is strictly not allowed, and your account will be terminated straight away with a lifetime IP ban.
		</font>
		<br /><br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>5. Alt Buying</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		Alt Buying is when you make alternate accounts to buy an item that is limited when you have already bought the item with your main account. This will lead to immediate termination of your main account and permanent IP ban.
		</font>
		<br /><br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>6. Alt Donating</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		Alt Donating is basically the same as Alt Buying, you make alternate accounts to donate to your main account. This is a serious violation and will lead to immediate termination of your main account and a permanent IP ban.
		</font>
		<br /><br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>7. Bribery</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		Bribing users or staff is against the rules here at SP, and will not be tolerated. You will be immediately terminated if you bribe someone.
		</font>
		<br /><br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>8. Profanity</font>
		<br />

		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		BrickPlanet guarantees a kid-friendly environment, and it is extremely dangerous to Online Date. If you are caught, you will be banned immediately.
		</font>
		<br />
		<br />

				<br /><br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>
		10. Selling Items/Currency
		</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		BrickPlanet guarantees a secure purchase at our <a href='https://brickplanet.gq/upgrades.php'>upgrade page</a>. However, we do not allow user sales by selling BUX, limiteds, and accounts for any other currencies including USD, Microsoft Points, and so forth. Both sides of the sale will be banned for 3 or 7 days determining the sale.
		<br /><br />
		<font style='font-size:17px;'>
		11. Alt Spamming
		</font>
		<br />
		<font style='font-size:13px;'>
		Alt Spamming is a major issue in BrickPlanet, which is why you are only permitted to have 15 accounts on BrickPlanet. If you have more than 2 then your all your accounts will be terminated. You may make a new account after your accounts are terminated, but if you repeat the same offence one more time, you will be terminated again and IP banned permanently.
