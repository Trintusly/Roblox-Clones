Value: Hello, community! Welcome to the forums! Here, you may seek help from our admins and community members. You may also discuss topics related to the subforum you're in. In addition to our terms of service, we have created these forum guidelines for our users to follow. At certain times, BrickPlanet staff members may pin temporary threads that are to be followed as well as these guidelines. 

1. Please don't spam!
You should only post topics related to the topic you're posting in, and the topic you're discussing should be relevant. Spamming threads, posting advertisements, talking about your post count, ect. are all considered spam. Please keep the forum full of quality material!

2. Don't share personal information. It isn't safe!
You should keep all real life information about yourself, to yourself. No one else should be welcome to know your personal information! Phone numbers, email addresses, your real name, and your home address are all confidential information. You should also refrain from asking other users for their personal information. It's just not safe!

3. Do not discuss real life tragedies.
Real world events that involve sensitive topics should not be talked about on BrickPlanet. You are free to create groups commemorating the lives of those lost in real world tragedies, but please keep these topics away from the forums.

4. Do not post offsite links that are not permitted via our terms of service.
Offsite links can be harmful, both to you and your computer. You should never visit websites that you do not trust! BrickPlanet has allowed certain, admin approved offsite links (as per our terms) that you are allowed to post. Those links are:

Youtube.com and its URL shortener/subdomains (i.e. youtu.be/help.youtube.com)
Gyazo.com (screenshot program links)
Twitter.com and its subdomains (i.e. t.co)
Imgur.com (image uploading website)
Prntscr.com (screenshot program links) and its subdomains (i.e. prnt.sc)
Trello.com

In addition to this rule, moderators may review links and ban based on the content at the link. You should also link to "appropriate for all" content only!

5. Do not harass, troll, or put down others!
Be mature! Everyone here uses the same website. You should not be excluding anyone from the forums or trying to make the site an unenjoyable place to go. Instead, you should encourage new players and show them the ropes!

6. Don't post on inappropriate threads. Report them instead!
We appreciate it when people want to help the community by calling someone out on their inappropriate forum post, but this just bumps the post and brings it to the top of the forum. Instead, report the content by using the report abuse button so that a moderator can take care of it! 

7. Post in the correct subforum!
We know that the tumbleweeds fly in certain subforums, but please post topics related to the subforum you're posting in. Threads not pertaining to a subforum will merely be moved anyways, so it is a bit silly to break this rule to begin with.

8. Do not repost your deleted thread.
Posts deleted or moved by community moderators were deleted or moved for a reason. Instead of reposting them, you should message an online moderator and ask how the thread violated the rules so that you'll have a better understanding about our terms.

9. BrickPlanet staff and moderators are exempt from the rules!
BrickPlanet City staff members, moderators, directors, and other staff are exempt from rules we have for our users. This means that they can link to certain websites or post threads not pertaining to subforums. Our staff abide by a separate policy and are therefore excused from our forum and community guidelines. You should take heed to advice given by our staff members! We're here to help, and our inboxes are always open!

3: We can prob add a way to submit hats to try to get them in the store
4: It'd be harder to get hacked.
5: People can ask artists for requests instead of making it on their own. It would be higher quality.

Cons:
1: You can't donate
2: People don't have anywhere to put their items
3: If people want a certain outfit, they'll either have to find the exact parts, or ask a artist to make em, which can take a little while.


There's more pros than cons here, so i think it's a change for the good

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid—a system of racial segregation that privileged whites—he and the ANC committed themselves to the apartheid government's overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 anti-apartheid Defiance Campaign and the 1955

https://discordapp.com/channels/260561423887761409/260965287661273109

We consider and choose which assets will be uploaded to our store, and the others will be preserved for another time, having uploaded a minimum of at least five or more assets into the shop will make you eligible to receive the "Artist" badge. Bet remember, five or more!

Community sites and votes are fine too, by this, I mean you can upload your asset and have the community vote on it, if they do like it, that's also a chance to submit your assets there too, for an even high chance for it to be published! Need a place to upload your assets? You can use:

- http://prntscr.com/
- Trello.com
- http://imgur.com/
- Twitter.com
- And of course, the site itself, https://brickplanet.gq

Also, please keep in mind that some submitted assets may be configured in order to keep it nice and simple. Be sure to make great assets! Inappropriate assets may result in a ban/termination from the site, so please be wary of that! Any questions? Be sure to PM a moderator.

Anyways, have a great day buddies! We would love to see your ideas come to a reality in the Store!

Value: Hey everyone, hope you're all are enjoying the new UI update and having a wonderful day. The UI update is a temporary site interface until we can rebuild the website entirely, which will take a few days to a couple of weeks. If you've encountered any bugs, please feel free to report it to us in our discord server, or via private messages to an administrator.

Now, about the user invite contest. As most of you guys know the website is only 2 days old, which means we don't have alot of users, and we could use more. What we've decided to do to help the community by giving back when inviting users is giving 50 cash for every person you invite to bloxcity (they must join, and must message Peridax claiming they've been registered by you), and we'll be investigating so don't try anything silly.

Once we reach a total of 1,000 users, we'll be much more active, and hopefully we can roll out faster updates, and improve the website in various ways.

Right now, we're looking for GFX artists, web developers (preferably php developers), and community managers. If you're interested in any of those positions, please visit us at our discord and send a message to Peridax.
